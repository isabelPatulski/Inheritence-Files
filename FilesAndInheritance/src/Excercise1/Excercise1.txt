Inheritance

In inhertitance you start out with making one parent class.
When you have made your class you can make “children” to it.
You do this by adding the extends keyword at the end of your class and then choose your parent class.
The “child” will inherit the attributes and/or methods the “parent” has.
You can also add more attributes or methods to the child class. Theese will only be in the “child” class.
Every child from the same parent, can be polymorphed into eachoter.
